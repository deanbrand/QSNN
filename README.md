# Quantum Spiking Neural Networks
Quantum Spiking Neural Networks using Quantum Leaky Integrate-and-Fire neurons. Fully connected NNs and CNNs shown on MNIST, FashionMNIST, and Kuzushiji-MNIST datasets.

To use, install requirements with
`pip install -r requirements.txt`
and run any of the Jupyter Notebooks. The main notebook is `alpha_mnist.ipynb`, while the rest are derivatives for the CNNs and other datasets.
